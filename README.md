### HubSpot Project
You're in charge of implementing a new analytics "sessions" view. You're given a set of data that consists of individual web page visits, along with a visitorId which is generated by a tracking cookie that uniquely identifies each visitor. From this data we need to generate a list of sessions for each visitor.

You can get the raw event data from the dataset API at ```sample_url```

The data set looks like this:
```python
{
    "events": [
         {
             "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
             "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
             "timestamp": 1512754583000
         },
         {
             "url": "/pages/a-small-dog",
             "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
             "timestamp": 1512754631000
         },
        {
            "url": "/pages/a-big-talk",
            "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
            "timestamp": 1512709065294
        },
        {
            "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
            "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
            "timestamp": 1512711000000
        },
        {
            "url": "/pages/a-big-river",
            "visitorId": "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039",
            "timestamp": 1512754436000
        },
        {
            "url": "/pages/a-sad-story",
            "visitorId": "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b",
            "timestamp": 1512709024000
        }
    ]
}
```

Given this input data, we want to create a set of sessions of the incoming data. A sessions is defined as a group of events from a single visitor with no more than 10 minutes between each consecutive event. A visitor can have multiple sessions.

So given the example input data above, we would expect output which looks like:

```python
{
    "sessionsByUser": {
        "f877b96c-9969-4abc-bbe2-54b17d030f8b": [
            {
                "duration": 41294,
                "pages": [
                    "/pages/a-sad-story",
                    "/pages/a-big-talk"
                ],
                "startTime": 1512709024000
            },
            {
                "duration": 0,
                "pages": [
                    "/pages/a-sad-story"
                ],
                "startTime": 1512711000000
            }
        ],
        "d1177368-2310-11e8-9e2a-9b860a0d9039": [
            {
                "duration": 195000,
                "pages": [
                    "/pages/a-big-river",
                    "/pages/a-big-river",
                    "/pages/a-small-dog"
                ],
                "startTime": 1512754436000
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Once the event data has been transformed into session, you will need to send the result via an http POST to ```https://sample_url```

# Results
Code passed the sample test case with message:
```
{"message":"Results match! Congratulations!"}
```
